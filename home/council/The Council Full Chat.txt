[19-Mar-21 01:24 PM] pipit123tyren#8021
An instant cold pack is a device that consists of two bags; one containing water, inside a bag containing ammonium nitrate, calcium ammonium nitrate or urea. When the inner bag of water is broken by squeezing the package, it dissolves the solid in an endothermic reaction.

[25-Mar-21 10:48 AM] pipit123tyren#8021
Identity theft and identity fraud are terms used to refer to all types of crime in which someone wrongfully obtains and uses another person's personal data in some way that involves fraud or deception, typically for economic gain.16 Nov 2020

[28-Mar-21 06:01 PM] sopahi#8189

[28-Mar-21 06:01 PM] THE CHEZ#3421
its quite close actually


[28-Mar-21 06:02 PM] sopahi#8189
and you gave the hint about 4 rooms on each floor


[28-Mar-21 06:02 PM] sopahi#8189
so that would be even easier


[28-Mar-21 06:02 PM] Altitudez1#3755
that might be wrong tho


[28-Mar-21 06:02 PM] THE CHEZ#3421
yeah each labeled 1 2 3 4

[03-Apr-21 07:11 PM] [CoFfEe] HuNtEr#7416
lol


[03-Apr-21 07:23 PM] cleverActon0126#0126
I mean, a Council should have an odd number of members to make stuff interesting. Or votes are gonna be 5-5


[03-Apr-21 07:23 PM] Annika#9644
True


[03-Apr-21 07:25 PM] sopahi#8189
but if something is too debatable, sides would be obvious right?


[03-Apr-21 07:26 PM] sopahi#8189
if stuff are 50-50 we can just leave it be


[03-Apr-21 07:33 PM] Altitudez1#3755
no it has to be uneven


[03-Apr-21 07:55 PM] sopahi#8189
isn‚Äôt evenness world peace?


[03-Apr-21 07:55 PM] sopahi#8189
when two opposites can coexist?


[03-Apr-21 08:12 PM] THE CHEZ#3421
alright then 11 people


[03-Apr-21 08:12 PM] sopahi#8189
we can have eleven?


[03-Apr-21 08:12 PM] THE CHEZ#3421
idk


[03-Apr-21 08:12 PM] cleverActon0126#0126
No


[03-Apr-21 08:12 PM] cleverActon0126#0126
10 is max


[03-Apr-21 08:12 PM] THE CHEZ#3421
oh


[03-Apr-21 08:12 PM] THE CHEZ#3421

[03-Apr-21 08:13 PM] cleverActon0126#0126

[03-Apr-21 08:13 PM] sopahi#8189

[03-Apr-21 08:13 PM] THE CHEZ#3421

[03-Apr-21 08:13 PM] sopahi#8189
hmmm nah


[03-Apr-21 08:13 PM] THE CHEZ#3421
I have an idea, when the vote comes down to a 50-50, someone random will vote twice


[03-Apr-21 08:14 PM] cleverActon0126#0126
Yeah we can use a name picker


[03-Apr-21 08:14 PM] THE CHEZ#3421

You have unlimited power of nothing


[03-Apr-21 08:20 PM] THE CHEZ#3421
Acton has so much power, we might as well name him Council Member 1


[03-Apr-21 08:20 PM] cleverActon0126#0126
Wait I have an idea


[03-Apr-21 08:20 PM] THE CHEZ#3421
yes?


[03-Apr-21 08:21 PM] THE CHEZ#3421
what is the idea?


[03-Apr-21 08:21 PM] cleverActon0126#0126
Someone be like the chairman and host all the votes so we can max out the 10 people


[03-Apr-21 08:24 PM] Altitudez1#3755
We still arguing about this?


[03-Apr-21 08:25 PM] THE CHEZ#3421
again, how is this arguing?


[03-Apr-21 08:26 PM] cleverActon0126#0126
I mean we are now democratic. Let's just vote kick or ban instead of admin abuse


[03-Apr-21 08:26 PM] THE CHEZ#3421
of course, we are a council after all


[03-Apr-21 08:43 PM] Altitudez1#3755

[04-Apr-21 12:54 PM] Altitudez1#3755
facts


[04-Apr-21 01:00 PM] sopahi#8189

1. Update chrome;

If someone dies during an exam, all the other students present pass.[1]
If a natural disaster occurs during an exam, all students present pass.[2]
If a university burns down or is destroyed otherwise, all current students immediately graduate with a bachelor's degree.[1]
A student who gets hit by a campus shuttle bus will receive free tuition.[3][4][5]

Pass by catastrophe
Pass by catastrophe is an academic urban legend proposing that if some particular catastrophic event occurs, students whose performance could have been affected by the event are automatically awarded passing grades, on the grounds that there would then be no way to assess them fairly and they should not be penalized for the catastrophe.
